An addon for [karaoke-web](https://github.com/barbeque-squared/karaoke-web), this allows people to submit highscores to the My Little Karaoke leaderboards.
It also returns simple json responses with simple error messages instead of having to parse archaic Ultrastar-based repsonses in your application.
